 Quick install instructions for RTEMS-4.7.1
 ******************************************

 If you want to built GeSys for the uC5282 (m68k)
 BSP then you need to fix a bug in linkcmds.
 The necessary patch is attached below. Just
 chdir to the RTEMS source topdir and issue

   patch -p0 -b < this_file

 (It is always a good idea to try a --dry-run first)

 Then you must re-build and re-install RTEMS (sorry).
 Later versions (not sure about 4.8 but the CVS head
 has it fixed) do not need to be patched.

 a) create a <top> directory and unpack the GeSys-2.4
    sources there.

 b) download and unpack rtemsNfs-1.7 in the <top> directory.

 c) download and unpack cexp-1.6.beta in the <top> directory.

 e) (Optionally) download and unpack libbspExt-1.4 in the
    <top> directory. This library only has benefits on
	powerpc and i386 platforms. (It is needed for EPICS
	on powerpc VME boards, though.)

 f) copy Makefile.top to <topdir>/Makefile

 At this point the <top> directory contains the following
 entries:

 	<top>/Makefile
	<top>/cexp-1.6.beta
	<top>/rtemsNfs-1.7
	<top>/GeSys-2.4
	[ optionally: <top>/libbspExt-1.4 ]

  g) set the RTEMS_MAKEFILE_PATH variable to point to
     your BSP's Makefile.inc

  h) make sure the cross-toolchain is found in your PATH

  i) chdir to <top> and issue make

  NOTE: the build process installs all headers, libraries
  and executables into the standard RTEMS tree next to
  the other RTEMS headers, libraries etc.
