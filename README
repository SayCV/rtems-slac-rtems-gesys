RTEMS GeSys ("Generic System") 
==============================

RTEMS GeSys is a general purpose application.
It is configured to support most of RTEMS' features
(all managers, networking, APIs) with generous limits.

The GeSys Makefile contains special "magic" to enforce
GeSys to be linked with most parts of the core system
libraries (libc, libstdc++, libgcc, librtemsbsp,
librtemscpu etc.) including full C++ support.
Additional libraries can be included by listing them
in the Makefile (add to OPT_LIBRARIES). Individual
objects may be excluded from the optional libraries
by listing them in an 'exclude_list' file in the
'config' subdirectory. Consult README.config for
more information.

The initialization task initializes and runs Cexp
as a powerful shell. The idea is that GeSys be used
to load and start 'real' applications at run-time.

RTEMS GeSys has been tested on the following BSPs:

    i386-pc386,

	powerpc-mvme23xx, powerpc-mvme2100 powerpc-svgm,
	powerpc-mvme5500, powerpc-beatnik, powerpc-mvme3100,
	powerpc-psim

	m68k-mvme167, m68k-uC5282
